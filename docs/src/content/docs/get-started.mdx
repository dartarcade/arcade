description: Get started with Dartseid, a Dart no magic web framework.

import { Card } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Dartseid is pure Dart, no magic framework for building web applications. It uses the pure `HttpServer` from `dart:io` for maximum performance and flexibility.

<Card icon="warning" title="Note">
  Dartseid is still in early development and is not ready for production use.
</Card>

### What does "no magic" mean?

The current state of Dart code generation leaves a lot to be desired. Dartseid is a framework that does not use code generation.
This means that you can use Dartseid without having to worry about `build_runner` running for minutes before your server even starts.

<Card icon="information" title="Info">
  Dartsied will eventually come with a CLI to scaffold a new project, but for
  now you can use the [example
  project](https://github.com/exaby73/dartseid/tree/main/example) as a starting
  point or you can follow the [minimal setup guide](#minimal-setup).
</Card>

### Minimal setup

#### Requirements

You should have the following installed on your machine:

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Dartseid requires Dart 3.0 or higher.

#### Create a new project

Let's generate a new Dart console app. The reason why we use the default console app is because it's barebones unlike the web server one
which is configured with shelf and other dependencies that we don't need.

```sh
dart create my_app
cd my_app
```

Then we can add `dartseid` as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml`:

```sh
dart pub add dartseid
```

We can delete the `lib` directory and the `test` directory as we won't need them in this example. Though, later on, you can utilize these
to split your code and test it.

_MacOS/Linux_

```sh
rm -rf lib test
```

_Windows_

```sh
rmdir /s /q lib test
```

#### Writing a simple echo server

In the `bin/my_app.dart` file, we can write the following code:

```dart
import 'package:dartseid/dartseid.dart';

Future<void> main() {
  // We start the server on port 8080.
  return runServer(port: 8080, init: () {
    // We define our routes here. The first argument is the path and the second is the handler.
    Route.get('/hello', (RequestContext context) => 'Hello World!');
  });
}

```

The code we wrote simply defines a route that returns a string. We can run the server by running the following command:

```sh
dart run --enable-vm-service
```

The `--enable-vm-service` flag is required to enable hot reloading. Now visit `http://localhost:8080/hello`
and you should see the string `Hello World!`.

Let's modify our code to return a JSON response with the current time as well as echo a message passed via the path:

```dart
import 'package:dartseid/dartseid.dart';

Future<void> main() {
  return runServer(port: 8080, init: () {
    Route.get('/hello', (RequestContext context) => 'Hello World!');

    // Add the following route
    Route.get('/hello/:message', (RequestContext context) {
      final message = context.pathParameters['message'];
      final time = DateTime.now().toIso8601String();

      return {
        'message': message,
        'time': time,
      };
    });
  });
}
```

Rerun `dart run --enable-vm-service` since adding routes will not be hot reloaded. Now if we visit `http://localhost:8080/hello/world` we should see the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "message": "world",
  "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

We have successfully created a simple echo server with Dartseid!
